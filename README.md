## Grid-based-HTML-CSS-ScreenKeyboard

Grid-based-HTML-CSS-ScreenKeyboard is an on-screen keyboard using HTML, CSS and the power of the grid layout. This repository showcases the initial stages of development, featuring a responsive design that offers a smaller keyboard by default. While lacking full functionality due to the absence of JavaScript, it serves as a foundation for future development.
